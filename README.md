# RandomActs
Random Acts of Kindess is a team building experience. You can think of it as a "secret snowflake". Each person is randomly assigned another person and will do an act of kindness for them. There are two versions here of the randomization and assignment of names. It was made for UConn Swing and Blues in Fall 2015.

There is a java program that randomizes and assigns. Then I made a website that lets users click on their name and see who their secret person is.

I made the python implementation later after watching Hannah Fry's "The Problem with Secret Santa" video on Numberphile's youtube. This is a command-line version.
