# RandomActs
Random Acts of Kindess is a team building experience. You can think of it as a "secret snowflake".

Each person is assigned another person and will do a random act of kindness for them.
This java program randomizes and keeps it all secret! The html is so everyone doesn't need to manually run the program from my laptop. They can click on their name and see who their secret person is.
